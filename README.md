# Neuralnet_from_scratch

Let's build a deep learning neural network from scratch, without using tensorflow or keras.
This exercise will help you to get deep understanding of how a simple neural network works,how the weights and bias are calculated and how
backpropagation is implemented to reduce the loss function.Finally how to make sure that your model demonstrates good performance.

# Implementation of neural net
The following steps are implemented to build a neural net:
<li>Initialise the parameters(weights and biases)</li>
<li>Define forward propogation</li>
<li>Define backward propagation</li>
<li>Define fit function</li>
<li>Define predict function</li>

<p>Check nn_from_scratch.ipynb file to get a more detailed explaination about how a neural net is implemented.</p>
<p>I have even attached few links that can help you understand the implementation of neural network in much greater detail.</p>
